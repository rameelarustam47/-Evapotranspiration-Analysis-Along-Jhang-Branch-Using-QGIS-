# Evapotranspiration-Analysis-Along-Jhang-Branch-Using-QGIS
Methodology (without raster sampling)
**1. Study Area and Data**

The study focuses on Jhang Branch, a canal branch in the region of interest.

ET raster data was obtained from Google Earth Engine for the Kharif season of 2022–2023.

A total of 1 ET raster was considered for this initial analysis.
**
2. Line Map Creation**

The Jhang Branch canal was manually digitized in QGIS using the Add Line Feature tool.

The line represents the canal’s path for future sampling and analysis.

The line layer was saved as a shapefile for reproducibility.

**3. Sampling Points (Planned)**

Sampling points were manually placed along the canal to capture ET variation along its course.

A total of 8 points were planned to cover start, middle, and tail-end locations.

Currently, the points exist as a temporary layer, and raster sampling was not completed due to this limitation.

**4. Planned Raster Sampling**

In a complete workflow, ET values would be extracted using QGIS Sample Raster Values tool for each point along the line.

The extracted values would then be used for analysis and visualization of ET variation along the canal.

**5. Reproducibility and Next Steps**

The methodology ensures that once points are saved as permanent layers, ET sampling can be conducted for multiple rasters and seasons.

**Future steps include:**

Converting points to a permanent shapefile

Sampling ET from Kharif and Rabi rasters

Exporting results for analysis and visualization
